HTML: This sets up the basic structure of the game. There are three buttons for Stone, Paper, and Scissors, and areas to display the choices and result.
CSS: Provides simple styling to center the game and make it look neat.
JavaScript: Handles the game logic. It listens for player input, randomly generates the computer's choice, and then displays the result based on the rules of the game.
This setup gives a fun and interactive way for the player to battle against the computer in a simple game of Stone, Paper, Scissors!
